# Stand-Down-at-Dark-King-Rayas-Castle

This is a console app video game made for a final project in C++ that was meant to be both an entertaining fiction story and a fine example of object oriented programming that requires
some C++ knowledge/Computer trivia knowledge to pass through.

It was made to follow a specific set of instructions but those instructions are kept private to preserve Bunker Hill's education plan but I was given permissions to share my code. 

At line 404 you encounter a line that was intentionally random as one of those requirements, should your journey end there you must try again.
